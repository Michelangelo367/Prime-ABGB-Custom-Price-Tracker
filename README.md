<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great apps available on the internet to track prices of big e-commerce sites such as Amazon and Flipkart, however, I didn't find one that was configured to track prices of PrimeABGB; an Indian vendor that sells computer parts and other electronics from stores across India. 

Hence, I created this very basic price tracker app to help me track the prices of multiple products which I was looking to purchase. This app even helped me to catch some discounts, that I would've otherwise missed, through which I saved approximately 10,000 INR :smile:.

Of course this oversimplified version of the app will not serve all of you, since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Built With

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)
* [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
First things first, this project is configured to track very few products which you may/may not be looking to buy. So you'll have to tinker a bit with the code to add your products to the list in order to start tracking them.
### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you need a couple of things installed...
* Download and Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and type the following to log into your heroku account ```heroku login ```. 
* Download and Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* ``` pip install requirements.txt```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Fork This Repo, and clone it locally using git.
2. In the dataset folder and change the ***Links.csv*** file by replacing the URL's in it with your own product URLs taken from PrimeABGB's website. 
3. Follow the usual steps for deployment to heroku and deploy your version of the app. It should be able to tell you the prices in one page.


<!-- ROADMAP 
## Roadmap
